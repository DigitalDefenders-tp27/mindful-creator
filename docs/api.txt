8.4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. Data Protection and Security
   - Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks
   - Enforce HTTPS across all API endpoints for secure data transmission
   - Follow OAuth 2.0 best practices for authentication when applicable
   - Implement proper CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
   - Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity

2. Performance and Reliability
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
   - Use caching strategies for frequently requested data to reduce server load
   - Implement graceful fallback mechanisms when external services fail
   - Monitor API performance metrics and set up alerts for anomalies
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

3. Service Availability
   - Deploy services across multiple availability zones where possible
   - Implement health checks and automated recovery procedures
   - Use containerization for consistent deployment environments
   - Maintain comprehensive API documentation to ensure proper usage
   - Implement versioning to allow for backward compatibility

4. External Dependencies
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for YouTube API failures
   - Cache responses from NLP model to reduce dependency on model availability
   - Monitor third-party API usage and set up alerts for rate limit approaches
   - Maintain local copies of critical external datasets when possible
   - Document alternative workflows when external services are unavailable

9. APIs

9.1. List of APIs Used/Provided

External APIs Used:
- YouTube Data API: Used to fetch comments from YouTube videos for analysis
- Google Maps API: Used in the Creator Wellbeing feature for locating medical resources

Internal APIs Provided:
- YouTube Comment Analysis API: Analyzes sentiment and toxicity in YouTube comments
- Relaxation Activities API: Manages relaxation activities and user ratings
- Games API: Handles memory match game functionality
- Copyright API: Provides copyright information and notice generation
- Visualisation API: Delivers data for dashboard visualisations
- Notes API: Manages user notes and journal entries
- Health API: Provides system health and diagnostic information

9.2. Authentication/Authorization

The Mindful Creator API implements several authentication mechanisms:

1. Password Protection
   - Simple password protection is implemented for accessing the website
   - This acts as a basic gating mechanism rather than robust authentication

2. CORS Protection
   - Strict CORS policy allowing only specific origins:
     - http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:5173 (local development)
     - https://mindful-creator.vercel.app (production)
     - https://tiezhu.org and https://www.tiezhu.org (custom domains)
     - https://www.inflowence.org and https://inflowence.org
     - https://mindful-creator-production.up.railway.app
     - https://api.tiezhu.org
   - Vercel domain regex pattern for preview environments

3. JWT Implementation (Where Applicable)
   - JWT authentication for protected API endpoints
   - Token validation and expiration handling

4. API Key Management
   - External API keys (like YouTube API, Google Maps) stored securely and not exposed to clients
   - Kaggle API key for dataset access stored securely

9.3. Rate Limits

1. External API Rate Limits
   - YouTube API: Managed according to Google's quotas (typically 10,000 units per day)
   - Google Maps API: Subject to Google's usage limits based on account tier

2. Internal API Rate Limits
   - YouTube Analysis API: Limited to 100 comments per request to manage resource usage
   - Rate limiting middleware implemented to prevent abuse:
     - General endpoints: 100 requests per minute per IP
     - Intensive operations (like comment analysis): 10 requests per minute per IP
   - Backend services configured with request timeouts to prevent hanging connections

3. Rate Limit Implementation
   - HTTP headers indicate rate limit status (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)
   - 429 Too Many Requests responses when limits exceeded
   - Exponential backoff recommended for client implementations
